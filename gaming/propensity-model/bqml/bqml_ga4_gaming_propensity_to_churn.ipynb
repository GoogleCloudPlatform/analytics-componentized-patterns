        "# Overview\n",
        "This notebook shows you how you can train, evaluate, and deploy a propensity model in BigQuery ML to predict user retention on a mobile game, based on app measurement data from Google Analytics 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Propensity modeling in the mobile gaming industry\n",
        "According to a [2019 study](https://gameanalytics.com/reports/mobile-gaming-industry-analysis-h1-2019) on 100K mobile games by the Mobile Gaming Industry Analysis, most mobile games only see a 25% retention rate for users after the first 24 hours, and any game \"below 30% retention generally needs improvement\". In light of this, using machine learning -- to identify the propensity that a user churn after day 1 -- can allow app developers to incentivize users at higher risk of churning to return.\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict the propensity (a.k.a. likelihood) that a user will return vs churn, you can use classification algorithms, like logistic regression, XGBoost, neural networks, or AutoML Tables, all of which are available with BigQuery ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Propensity modeling in BigQuery ML\n",
        "With BigQuery ML, you can train, evaluate and deploy our models directly within BigQuery using SQL, which saves time from needing to manually configure ML infrastructure. You can train and deploy ML models directly where the data is already stored, which also helps to avoid potential issues around data governance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using classification models that you train and deploy in BigQuery ML, you can predict propensity using the output of the models. The models outputs provide a probability score between 0 and 1.0 -- how likely the model predicts that the user will churn (1) or not churn (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the probability (propensity) scores, you can then, for example, target users who may not return on their own, but could potentially return if they are provided with an incentive or notification.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Not just churn -- propensity modeling for any behavior\n",
        "Propensity modeling is not limited to predicting churn. In fact, you can calculate a propensity score for any behavior you may want to predict. For example, you may want to predict the likelihood a user will spend money on in-app purchases. Or, perhaps you can predict the likelihood of a user performing \"stickier\" behaviors such as adding and playing with friends, which could lead to longer-term retention and organic user growth. Whichever the case, you can easily modify this notebook to suit your needs, as the overall workflow will still be the same."

([Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labpixies.flood), [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flood-it!/id476943146?mt=8)).

Every row in the dataset is an event, with various characteristics relevant to that event stored in a nested format within the row. While Google Analytics logs many types of events already by default, developers can also customize the types of events they also wish to log.\n",

You can tailor user experience by targeting your identified users through Firebase services such as Remote Config, Cloud Messaging, and In-App Messaging. This will involve importing the segment data from BigQuery into Firebase. After that you can send notifications to the users, configure the app for them, or follow the user journeys across devices.\n",

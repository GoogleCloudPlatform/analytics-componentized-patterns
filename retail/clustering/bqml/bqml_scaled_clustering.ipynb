    "# How to build k-means clustering models for market segmentation using BigQuery ML\n",
    "\n",
    "A common marketing analytics challenge is to understand consumer behavior and develop customer attributes or archetypes.  As organizations get better at tackling this problem, they can activate marketing strategies to incorporate additional customer knowledge into their campaigns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms are a common vehicle to address this challenge. They allow businesses to better segment and understand their customers and users.  In the field of Machine Learning, which is a combination of both art and science, unsupervised learning may require more art compared to supervised learning algorithms.  By definition, unsupervised learning has no single metric to guide the algorithm's learning process. Instead, the data science team will need to work hand in hand with business owners to determine feature selection, optimal number of clusters (the number of clusters is often abbreviated as k), and most importantly, to gain a deeper understanding of what each cluster represents.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can clustering algorithms help businesses succeed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms can help companies identify groups of similar customers that can be used for targeting in advertising campaigns. This is paramount as we are breathing a prediction era where customers expect personalization from brands. \n",
    " \n",
    "Using a public sample Google Analytics 360 e-commerce dataset on BigQuery, you will learn how to create and deploy clustering algorithms in production. You will also get an example of how to navigate unsupervised learning.  Keep in mind, your clusters will be even more meaningful when you bring additional data.\n"

    "In this section, we want to determine the proper k value.  Determining the right value of k depends completely on the use case.  There are straight forward examples that will simply tell you how many clusters are needed.  Suppose you are pre-processing hand written digits - this tells us k should be 10. Or perhaps your business stakeholder only wants to deliver three different marketing campaigns and needs you to identify three clusters of customers, then setting k=3 might be meaningful. However, the use case is sometimes more open ended and you may want to explore different numbers of clusters to see how your datapoints group together with the minimal error within each cluster. To accomplish this process, we start by performing the 'Elbow Method', which simply charts loss vs k. Then, we'll also use the Davies-Bouldin score.\n",

    "Note - when you run this notebook, you will get different results, due to random cluster initialization.  If you'd like to consistently return the same cluster for reach run, you may explicitly select your initialization through hyperparameter selection (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#kmeans_init_method). \n",
    "\n",
    "Making our k selection:  There is no perfect approach or process when determining the optimal k value. It can often be determined by business rules or requirements.  In this example, there isn't a simple requirement, so these considerations can also be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   We start with the 'elbow method', which is effectively charting loss vs k.  Sometimes, though not always, there's a natural 'elbow' where incremental clusters do not drastically reduce loss.  In this specific example, and as you often might find, unfortunately there isn't a natural 'elbow', so we must continue our process. \n",
    "2.  Next, we chart Davies-Bouldin vs k.  This score tells us how 'different' each cluster is, with the optimal score at zero.  With 5 clusters, we see a score of ~1.4, and only with k>9, do we see better values. \n",
    "3. Finally, we begin to try to interpret the difference of each model. You can review the evaluation module for various models to understand distributions of our features.  With our data, we can look for patterns by gender, house hold income, and shopping habits.\n"

Although this by itself is helpful, we also recommend a process to ingest these scores back into GA360. The easiest way to export your BigQuery ML predictions from a BigQuery table to Google Analytics 360 is to use the MoDeM (Model Deployment for Marketing, https://github.com/google/modem) reference implementation. MoDeM helps you load data into Google Analytics for eventual activation in Google Ads, Display & Video 360 and Search Ads 360."

    "In this exercise, we’ve accomplished some cool things with k-means in BigQuery ML.  Most notably, we’re able to join online and offline user level information to gain more insight into a holistic view of our customers.  We’ve modeled user behavior, and detailed an approach to determine the optimal number of clusters.  We’re able to take this insight and apply to future behavior through inference.  Finally, we can import this inference score back into GA360 for future marketing campaigns. "

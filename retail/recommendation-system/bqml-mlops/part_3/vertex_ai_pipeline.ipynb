    "This is part three of the tutorial where you will learn how to run same code in [Part One](../README.md) (with minor changes) in Google's new Vertex AI pipeline. Vertex Pipelines helps you to automate, monitor, and govern your ML systems by orchestrating your ML workflow in a serverless manner, and storing your workflow's artifacts using Vertex ML Metadata. By storing the artifacts of your ML workflow in Vertex ML Metadata, you can analyze the lineage of your workflow's artifacts — for example, an ML model's lineage may include the training data, hyperparameters, and code that were used to create the model.\n",

    "* Follow the how-to guide [create flex slots, reservation and assignment in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-get-started) for training ML models. <strong>Make sure to create Flex slots and not month/year slots so you can delete them after the tutorial.</strong> \n",
    "* Build and push a docker image using [this dockerfile](dockerfile) as the base image for the Kubeflow pipeline components. \n",
    "* Create or use a [Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) bucket to export the finalized model to. <strong>Make sure to create the bucket in the same region where you will create Vertex AI Endpoint to host your model.</strong> \n",
    "* If you do not specify a service account, Vertex Pipelines uses the Compute Engine default service account to run your pipelines. The Compute Engine default service account has the Project Editor role by default so it should have access to BigQuery as well as Google Cloud Storage.\n",

So togther, we can feed the resulting weights/factors as features among with other features to train the final XGBoost model. "

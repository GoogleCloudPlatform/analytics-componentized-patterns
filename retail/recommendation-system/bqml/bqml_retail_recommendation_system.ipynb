    "# Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, you’ll learn how to build a product recommendation system in a retail scenario using matrix factorization, and how to use the predicted recommendations to drive marketing activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are recommendation systems so important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of consumers today expect personalization — to see products and services relevant to their interests. Naturally, they can help businesses too. By learning from user behaviours and preferences, businesses can deliver their recommendations in a variety of ways, including personalized coupons, marketing emails, and search results, or targeted ads. Ultimately, this enables businesses to attract more customer spending with targeted cross-selling or upselling, while reducing unnecessary costs by marketing irrelevant products.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>\n",
    "_\"Companies that fail to show customers they know them and their buying preferences risk losing business to competitors who are more attuned to what their customers want.\"_  \n",
    ">_Harvard Business Review. “The Age of Personalization”. September 2018_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does matrix factorization work?\n",
    "Based on user preferences, matrix factorization (collaborative filtering) is one of the most common and effective methods of creating recommendation systems. For more information about how they work, see [this introduction to recommendation systems here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/matrix). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is BigQuery ML?\n",
    "[BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/bigqueryml-intro) enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery by using standard SQL queries. This means, if your data is already in BigQuery, you don’t need to export your data to train and deploy machine learning models — by training, you’re also deploying in the same step. Combined with BigQuery’s auto-scaling of compute resources, you won’t have to worry about spinning up a cluster or building a model training and deployment pipeline. This means you’ll be saving time building your machine learning pipeline, enabling your business to focus more on the value of machine learning instead of spending time setting up the infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard of [Recommendations AI](https://cloud.google.com/recommendations), a Google Cloud product purpose-built for real-time recommendations on a website using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Matrix factorization with BigQuery ML, on the other hand, is a more generic ML algorithm that can be used for offline and online recommendations (e.g. personalized e-mail campaigns).\n"

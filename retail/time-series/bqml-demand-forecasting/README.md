# How to build a time series demand forecasting model using BigQuery ML


The goal of [this notebook](bqml_retail_demand_forecasting.ipynb) is to provide an end-to-end solution for forecasting the demand of multiple retail products. Using historical sales data of liquor products, you will learn how to train a demand forecasting model using BigQuery ML and how to visualize the forecasted values in a dashboard.

By the end of [this notebook](bqml_retail_demand_forecasting.ipynb), you will know how to:
* _pre-process data_ into the correct format needed to create a demand forecasting model using BigQuery ML
* _train the time series model_ in BigQuery ML
* _evaluate the model_
* _make predictions on future demand using the model_
* _take action on the forecasted predictions:_
  * _create a dashboard to visualize the forecasted demand using Data Studio_
